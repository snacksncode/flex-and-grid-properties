# flex-and-grid-properties
Quick side-project. Simple visualization of different flex & grid properties and their affects on items

# How to actually use this darn thing
I might make it public someday but for now, download a repo do
```console
yarn install
```
or
```console
npm install
```

And then build it via
```console
yarn build
```
or
```console
npm run build
```

Then just open index file inside newly created `/dist` folder
